# Impact Invest

## Background

Impact Invest is a crowdfunding platform for projects designed to have a positive impact on the world. Users can explore projects and pledge money if they feel inspired. Better yet, they can create their own projects and raise money. This app is a portfolio project so all transactions involving money are fake.

## Technologies Used

- OAuth
- HTML / CSS
- Heroku
- Trello

## Getting Started

- https://trello.com/b/GonTeUFJ/user-stories

This project is no longer hosted on Heroku. I will provide a URL once I find a new place to host the application.

I used Trello for project planning. In the link you can view completed user stories as well as user stories that I would like to implement in the future.

## Next Steps

- Target funding date functionality.
- Image uploads (as opposed to the image URL method currently employed).
- Make the app more thematic. As the name suggests, Impact Invest is meant for projects that have a positive impact. However, currently the app could really be used for anything.
- Continue learning how to make web apps even more responsive.
